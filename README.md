# AI Chatbot with DuckDuckGo Web Search Agent

This project is a Streamlit-based AI chatbot that uses an OpenAI-compatible model and integrates a DuckDuckGo web search tool for up-to-date information retrieval.

## Features

- Chat with an AI assistant powered by OpenAI-compatible models.
- If the assistant is unsure or needs current information, it uses DuckDuckGo search.
- Results are summarized and presented in the chat.
- Simple Streamlit web interface.

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [openai](https://pypi.org/project/openai/)
